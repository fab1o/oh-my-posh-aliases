This repository contains:
- Oh My Posh Theme
- Oh My Zch Aliases and Functions

This theme is loosely based on [robbyrussell](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes#robbyrussell) oh-my-posh's theme and a configurable set of aliases and functions to pump your Z (zsh) shell. This theme fixes an [issue](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/issues/6204) with the robbyrussell's theme where the "âœ—" was incorrectly configured in the oh-my-posh version of robbyrussell's [original](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/robbyrussell.zsh-theme#L6) Oh My Zsh's theme.

### Oh My Posh Theme

### Aliases + Functions
